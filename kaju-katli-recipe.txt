Ingredients

Cashew nuts - 100 grams

Soak the cashews in water for 6-8 hrs. Remove it from the water and grind to a smooth paste. Do not add water while grinding.
Measure the quantity of paste, take equal quantity of sugar. For e.g: If there is 1/4 cup of cashew paste, take 1/4 cup of sugar.
Take a heavy bottomed pan or a non stick pan and melt the sugar. Add the cashew paste and cook for few minutes. Add the ghee.
When it starts leaving the sides of the pan, add the cardamom powder and mix well.
Remove it on the platform and knead to a smooth ball. You will get a nice dough of it. 
Flatten the same with the rolling pin on a plate. Cut it into any desired shape. Traditionally it is cut in diamond shape. Enjoy!!
